<h1>Bitcoin Explained for new people</h1>
<h2>Bitcoin was invented as a peer-to-peer system for online payments that does not require a trusted central authority.</h2>
<h2>Since its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has grown into a technology, a currency, an investment vehicle, and a community of users.</h2>
<h2>In this guide we hope to explain what Bitcoin is and how it works as well as describe how you can use it to improve your life.</h2>

<h1>What is Bitcoin?</h1>
<h2>Since anything digital can be copied over and over again, the hard part about implementing a digital payment system is making sure that nobody spends the</h2>

<h2>The core innovation that makes Bitcoin special is that it uses consensus in a massive peer-to-peer network to verify transactions.</h2>
<h2>This results in a system where payments are non-reversible, accounts cannot be frozen, and transaction fees are much lower.</h2>

<h1>Where do bitcoins come from?</h1>
<h2>We go more in-depth about this on the page about mining, but hereâ€™s a very simple explanation:</h2> 
<h2>Some users put their computers to work verifying transactions in the peer-to-peer network mentioned above.</h2>
<h2>These users are rewarded with new bitcoins proportional to the amount of computing power they donate to the network.</h2>
