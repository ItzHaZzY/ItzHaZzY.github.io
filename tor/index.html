<h1>Tor Infomation</h1>
<h3>The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet.
<h3>Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection,
<h3>thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.
<h3>Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool,
<h3>allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content.
<h3>Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.

<h3>Individuals use Tor to keep websites from tracking them and their family members, 
<h3>or to connect to news sites, instant messaging services, or the like when these are blocked by their local Internet providers.
<h3>Tor's onion services let users publish web sites and other services without needing to reveal the location of the site.
<h3>Individuals also use Tor for socially sensitive communication: chat rooms and web forums for rape and abuse survivors,
<h3>or people with illnesses.

<h3>Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and dissidents.
<h3>Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use Tor to allow their workers to connect to their home website while they're in a foreign country,
<h3>without notifying everybody nearby that they're working with that organization.

<h3>Groups such as Indymedia recommend Tor for safeguarding their members' online privacy and security.
<h3>Activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation
<h3>(EFF) recommend Tor as a mechanism for maintaining civil liberties online. 
<h3>Corporations use Tor as a safe way to conduct competitive analysis, and to protect sensitive procurement patterns from eavesdroppers.
<h3>They also use it to replace traditional VPNs, which reveal the exact amount and timing of communication.
<h3>Which locations have employees working late? Which locations have employees consulting job-hunting websites?
<h3>Which research divisions are communicating with the company's patent lawyers?

<h3>A branch of the U.S. Navy uses Tor for open source intelligence gathering
<h3>And one of its teams used Tor while deployed in the Middle East recently.
<h3>Law enforcement uses Tor for visiting or surveilling web sites without leaving government IP addresses in their web logs,
<h3>and for security during sting operations.
